## Technical:
Third-Eye is made using following tools:
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) - It is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development.
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - An open source Artificial Intellengence library.
### Installation:
 Just clone or download the repository and open the project in Android Studio with Tensorflow installed.
### Development:

* Want to contribute and add a feature ?
   * pull requests and we will be more than happy to merge.
